# InspectR
This tool allows you to inspect incomming http request on a remote network.

You can think of it as 'fiddler for webhooks', to view and inspect http request data from webhooks
or other http clients not running in a local network.

It is based on the idea of http://requestb.in

You can view a live site running InspectR and play with it on http://inspectb.in
